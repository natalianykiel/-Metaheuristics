# Metaheuristic Algorithms Repository

This repository contains implementations of various **metaheuristic algorithms** used for solving complex optimization problems.

## Included Algorithms

- **ACO** – *Ant Colony Optimization*: A bio-inspired algorithm based on the behavior of ants searching for food.
- **ACOThreading** – A multithreaded version of the Ant Colony Optimization algorithm for improved performance.
- **GeneticAlgorithm** – *Genetic Algorithm*: A population-based evolutionary algorithm inspired by the process of natural selection and genetics.
- **ParticleSwarm** – *Particle Swarm Optimization*: Inspired by the social behavior of bird flocks and fish schools, it is effective for continuous optimization problems.
- **SimulatedAnnealing** – *Simulated Annealing*: Mimics the physical process of heating and slowly cooling a material to find a low-energy state, allowing for occasional worse moves to escape local optima.

## Applications

These algorithms can be applied to a wide variety of problems, including:
- Combinatorial optimization (e.g., Traveling Salesman Problem)
- Function minimization or maximization
- Scheduling
- Machine learning hyperparameter tuning
- Resource allocation
